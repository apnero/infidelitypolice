        <h1>Connecticut Private Investigator Offers Advice on How to Handle
        Opposite Sex Relationships</h1>
        Leading private investigator says that just because a spouse has a
        close relationship with a member of the opposite sex, it does not mean
        that the spouse is being unfaithful.<br>
        <br>
        “It can certainly be problematic for a marriage if one person engages
        in what may be perceived as threatening behavior, such as having a
        close friend that is a member of the opposite sex,” says Christopher
        Paoletti, Founder and President of Infidelity Investigations
        (http://www.infidelitypolice.com), a Connecticut private investigation
        firm that specializes in infidelity cases. “When ever a friendship
        blossoms between a spouse and a member of the opposite sex, the married
        couple should have a frank discussion about the slippery slope of
        familiarity that is always the beginning of marital infidelity.”<br>
        <br>
        Paoletti says that it is never easy to discuss a spouse’s friendship
        with a member of the opposite sex, particularly when they may be
        potentially building bonds. Spouses do not want to seem jealous or
        controlling, he says, but these sorts of relationships can be the
        precursor to an affair.<br>
        <br>
        “Most people who end up cheating on their spouse rarely begin with ill
        intentions. They simply believe they are just friends,” says Paoletti.
        “However, when any married individual defends an opposite-sex
        relationship with the ‘we’re just friends’ excuse, a red flag should go
        up.”<br>
        <br>
        Paoletti says that if a spouse is concerned about a competing
        opposite-sex relationship, that relationship should be suspended until
        the marriage can be stabilized and a safe connection is established
        again.<br>
        <br>
        “To continue in that competing relationship, regardless of how
        threatening it might actually be, is harmful to the long-term trust and
        safety of the marriage,” says Paoletti. “I’ve seen so many individuals
        unassumingly slide into an affair from seemingly innocent interactions
        with the opposite sex. As a result, I encourage caution and boundaries
        in same-sex friendships.”<br>
        <br>
        Paoletti says that, regardless of the arrangement, it needs to support
        the marriage. If the final friendship arrangement still makes a spouse
        uncomfortable, he or she should stay with the conversation until it can
        be resolved in the best interest of the marriage.<br>
        <br>
        “The concerns of a spouse need to be heard and taken seriously,” says
        Paoletti. “An actual sexual affair doesn’t have to happen for trust to
        be damaged in a marriage. A relationship can suffer when partners don’t
        respond to each other’s fears and concerns.”<br>
        <br>
