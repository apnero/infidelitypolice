        <h1>Connecticut Private Investigator Offers Tips on Catching a Cheating
        Wife or Girlfriend</h1>
        Leading private investigator says that women are good at hiding
        infidelity, and unlike men, with whom the signs are often obvious, a
        woman can cheat and the man may never know.<br>
        <br>
        “Most of the cheating spouse scandals that dominate the news involve
        cheating men,” says Christopher Paoletti, Founder and President of
        Infidelity Investigations (<a href=
        "http://www.infidelitypolice.com/">http://www.infidelitypolice.com</a>),
        a Connecticut private investigation firm that specializes in infidelity
        cases. “However, women cheat too and, although the signs are not as
        obvious, they are there – you just need to know how to spot them.”<br>
        <br>
        Paoletti says that the first sign of a cheating wife or girlfriend is a
        drastic change in her wardrobe.<br>
        <br>
        “When she starts to dress differently, or suddenly shows an interest in
        her appearance, it may be a sign that she's making herself look good
        for another man,” Paoletti says. “Of course, women like new clothes, so
        don't get paranoid if she continues her normal shopping patterns.”<br>
        <br>
        Changes in sexual behavior, however, may be more telling.<br>
        <br>
        “If she becomes distant in the bedroom, particularly when she once had
        a healthy sexual appetite, she may be getting satisfied by someone
        else,” says Paoletti. “On the other hand, women that once had little
        interest in sex, but are now going wild in bed, may be learning some
        new tricks from another man.”<br>
        <br>
        Changes in communications and friendships may also be a sign that a
        woman is cheating on her man, explains Paoletti.<br>
        <br>
        “Perhaps she is being more protective of her cell phone and more
        private when she talks on the phone,” says Paoletti. “Also, if she has
        been talking to her spouse or significant other less than usual and has
        been spending time with a new male friend, there is a possibility that
        something may not be right.”<br>
        <br>
        Of course, the universal sign of cheating, for both men and women, is a
        drastic change in schedule that requires them to be away from home more
        often than usual.<br>
        <br>
        “When a woman suddenly starts staying out later, often uses the excuse
        that she has to work late or that she was hanging with her girlfriends
        until two am at least three nights per week, it is a possible sign that
        she is spending those hours with a new lover,” says Paoletti. “Business
        trips and sudden changes in plans may be signs of infidelity as
        well.”<br>
        <br>
