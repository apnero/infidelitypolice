        <h1>Background Investigations</h1>
        Infidelity Investigations can provide you with a variety of background
        investigations. We can provide you with a Traditional Background
        Investigation or other investigations such as Pre-Matrimonial
        Background Investigation.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Traditional Background Investigations</strong>-There are many
        variations of Traditional Background Investigations. There are several
        packages that you can choose from, therefore call us to determine which
        package best suits your needs. Some of the information that our
        investigations can determine are: Name &amp; Alias information,
        Addresses (Past &amp; Present), Date of Birth, Social Security Number,
        Motor Vehicle (Regsitration information, Driver's License status &amp;
        history, and Title information), Bankruptcy Filings, National or
        State-wide Criminal History, National or State-wide Sex Offender
        Registry, Unlisted Phone Number, Death Certificate, and much more.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Pre-Matrimonial Background Investigation</strong>-This type of
        investigation is quickly gaining popularity due to the new fad of
        on-line dating services. Many individuals meet people on-line, whether
        in a dating service or in a chat room. It is becoming commonplace for
        someone to seek our services to learn more about an individual, they
        have met on-line, prior to going out on a first date. As the old saying
        goes"It's better to be safe than sorry"!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Pre-Employment Background Searches</strong>-This type of
        investigation has grown in popularity since September 11th. In the age
        of terrorism, identity fraud, and workplace violence it is very common
        for an employer to conduct a background check of all candidates for new
        hire. We can acquire and provide you with information such as Name and
        Address verification, Social Security Number verification, Real
        Property information, Civil filings, Motor Vehicle searches, and much
        more.<br>
        <br>
        Failure of an employer to conduct pre-employment background checks
        might result in liability if that employee later engages in workplace
        violence. Some insurance companies might also refuse to pay in
        situations of workplace violence where the employer neglected to
        conduct a pre-employment background check. Therefore, why take any
        chances? Reduce your liabilty and protect your employees via conducting
        a pre-employment background check on your candidates for new hire.<br>
        <br>
        Please call to inquire about the many other background investigations
        that we provide, such as finding out who a cell phone number belongs
        too, where do they live and if they married
