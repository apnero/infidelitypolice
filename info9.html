        <h1>Connecticut Private Investigator Says That Social Media Has Been
        Known to Ruin Relationships</h1>
        Leading private investigator says that a cheating spouse doesn’t need
        social media to be unfaithful, but it can certainly fuel the fire.<br>
        <br>
        According to Christopher Paoletti, Founder and President of Infidelity
        Investigations (<a href=
        "http://www.infidelitypolice.com/">http://www.infidelitypolice.com</a>),
        a Connecticut private investigation firm that specializes in infidelity
        cases, text messaging and social networking websites, such as Facebook
        and MySpace, can not only bring people together, but they can also
        drive a wedge between couples as well.<br>
        <br>
        “I hear repeatedly from clients that they are tired of playing second
        fiddle to digital devices,” says Paoletti. “Whether innocent or not,
        digital relationships not only place a strain on marriages, they arouse
        suspicion and, more often than not, that suspicion often turns out to
        be true.”<br>
        <br>
        Paoletti says texting and participation in social networking does not
        break up a marriage, people do. However, opportunity is a key predictor
        of infidelity, and social media outlets have certainly increased
        opportunity.<br>
        <br>
        "Decades ago, if a person found a co-worker interesting and later
        thought about calling them at home, just to say hello, they would have
        to ask themselves whether it was appropriate,” says Paoletti. “These
        sorts of stopgaps are now gone because texts and e-mails can be
        delivered privately. Sending a little message, at least at first, can
        be seemingly innocent.”<br>
        <br>
        Now, Paoletti says, spouses can carry on an affair right under their
        partner’s nose.<br>
        <br>
        Paoletti suggests that when it comes to social networking, spouses
        should share passwords to avoid fights and suspicion.<br>
        <br>
        “The bottom line is, if you find yourself e-mailing something that you
        would not want your spouse to know about, you are in danger of crossing
        a line,” he says. “If you get a ‘friend’ request from an old flame, be
        open with your spouse about whether to reply or not.”<br>
        <br>
        According to Paoletti, communication is the key to a healthy
        relationship.<br>
        <br>
        “Anyone that sees an increase in text messaging or social media usage,
        particularly with a member of the opposite sex, should take those
        concerns very seriously,” says Paoletti. “Hiring a private investigator
        to confirm those suspicions is sometimes the best course of
        action.”<br>
        <br>
