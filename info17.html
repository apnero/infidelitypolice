        <div class="center">
            by Team 8 Investigation Alan Cohn<br>
            Posted Feb. 6, 2007<br>
            10:00 PM
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        (WTNH) _ What can you find out about your friends, neighbors, husband,
        or wife? The answer is just about anything. Background checks are
        becoming more and more common these days and more and more
        intrusive.<br>
        <br>
        The State of Connecticut now does background checks on school bus
        drivers, new police officers, government appointees.<br>
        <br>
        "Their tax records, it may include credit history," Connecticut State
        Police spokesman Lt. J. Paul Vance said.<br>
        <br>
        "Telephone records?" "Yes. It will. I will say be limitless. It's very
        intense and in depth examination of a person's history."<br>
        <br>
        Police and other law enforcement agencies have access to the FBI's
        national criminal history data base.<br>
        <br>
        "It's not 100-percent foolproof."<br>
        <br>
        But now anyone can do background checks on the web. Employers can
        screen potential employees. Anybody and investigate anyone for prices
        ranging from $15 to $50. But <strong>Chris Paoletti</strong>, a
        <a href="http://infidelitypolice.com/"><strong>private
        investigator</strong></a> in Bridgeport cautions here too the
        information isn't always accurate.<br>
        <br>
        "The ones on the internet I think some of them are scams," he said.
        "They take your money. They are pretty much doing telephone book and
        white pages to see what kind of information they can find."<br>
        <br>
        But when it comes to digging up dirt on someone the most effective way
        continues to be the lowest tech way -- going through their garbage.
        This is how Paoletti discovered how someone he was doing a background
        check on was violating the non-compete clause in their employment
        contract.<br>
        <br>
        "I found an old partnership agreement in the dumpster. Unbelievable. He
        was signing off on particular jobs, writing checks."<br>
        <br>
        But today the biggest part of Paoletti's business is doing background
        checks on people suspected of cheating on their spouse or boyfriend or
        girlfriend.<br>
        <br>
        One successful Connecticut businessman, who doesn't want to be
        identified, has been married 25-years and has two young children. He
        became suspicious when, while away on businesses trips, his wife with
        increasing frequency, would tell him "she is going to the mall shopping
        or to the movies with her friends and have a baby-sitter come to watch
        our children."<br>
        <br>
        So he contacted Chris Paoletti who now has the web site "Infidelity
        Investigations."<br>
        <br>
        "It was a picture of her going into a restaurant with someone who
        wasn't one of her girlfriends. It was with a male companion," Paoletti
        said.<br>
        <br>
        But as we've seen background checks don't way give the complete
        picture. And that's why this Connecticut businessman is not sure what
        he's going to do next.<br>
        <br>
        "Is this going to wind up in a divorce?" "I don't know. I don't want to
        lose my wife. But you just wanted to know. I want to know."<br>
        <br>
        President Bush just signed into law a bill which limits the ability of
        private investigators and the public from getting your telephone
        records. But as the saying goes "where there's a will there's a way"
        and "money talks." There are unscrupulous information brokers out there
        who will provide the records even through it's now illegal.<br>
