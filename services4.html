        charged? Allow us to assist you in building your defense.
        <strong>Christopher Paolettis</strong>, <a href=

        investigator</strong></a> has made hundreds of criminal arrests over
        the course of his career. He has successfully attended numerous schools
        and holds many certifications. Via interviews and /or Interrogations,
        <strong>Christopher Paoletti</strong> has successfully and legally
        obtained incriminating statements from many individuals and/or
        suspects. We can interview victims, witnesses, or government employees
        to obtain statements that could support your defense.
        <strong>Christopher Paoletti</strong> extremely familiar with police
        policies and procedures as well as police jargon and police radio
        communications. This can become quite useful when reviewing
        discoverable items such as recorded police radio transmissions and
        police reports. We could be a valuable asset to your firm and the
        success of your case!<br>

        <div class="special">
            <strong>D.W.I. Defense Investigations:</strong>
        </div>
        D.W.I. arrests are on the rise. "The only open and shut DUI cases are
        the ones where no defense is mounted". An investigation can determine
        if an individual was wrongly arrested and charged. We can determine
        whether or not probable cause even existed for the motor vehicle stop;
        without probable cause for the stop, the evidence gathered thereafter
        could be suppressed. Our investigation can reveal errors and mistakes
        made by the arresting officer, medical personnel, or other individuals
        related to the case. Although there is a national trend of equipping
        police vehicles with in-car cameras, very few officers realize that the
        videotape is discoverable. Officers become immune to the fact that the
        camera is even there. It is quite likely that our investigation will
        show inconsistencies between what the officer put in his report and
        what the videotape had recorded. <strong>Christopher paoletti</strong>,
        <a href=
        "/web/20150226114820/http://infidelitypolice.com/"><strong>private
        investigator</strong></a> has made hundreds of arrests including D.W.I.
        arrests. He was trained and certified in Breathalyzer Operation and
        more importantly the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus. He was also trained and
        certified to administer the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.
        <strong>Christopher Paoletti</strong> believes that "there is no other
        crime where more innocent people are arrested and convicted than there
        are in DUI/DWI prosecutions". Often times the arresting officer's
        reports depict a different sequence of events than the in-car video
        camera had recorded.<br>
        <br>
        Our investigation may uncover reasonable doubt sufficient to defend
        your case and win an acquittal. We will provide you with a detailed
        report that will dramatically support your defense against an improper
        D.W.I. arrest. What better way to build a defense against an improper
        D.W.I. arrest than to utilize the services of a retired police officer?
        There is none!<br>

            <strong>Witness or Victim Interviews:</strong>
        </div>
        We can interview witnesses and/or victims to obtain statements that
        could be beneficial to your needs. Over the course of his career he has
        interviewed hundreds of individuals. Statements are extremely helpful
        in litigation. It is important to obtain a statement as soon as
        possible because witnesses and victims could forget important details
        over time. Whether it is a written statement, verbal, or tape-recorded,
        we will document the interview findings and provide you with a detailed
        report.<br>

        Are you tired of the services that only make attempts during the
        daylight hours? Are you tired of the services that make only one
        attempt and return the subpoena to you thirty-days later because of
        failed attempts? We will not only locate the individual, but we will
        make as many attempts as necessary to serve the subpoena or legal
        document. The best part is, we are extremely successful because we
        attempt to serve the subpoenas/documents when the individuals are
        likely home, which is at night and weekends. Don’t waste time with
        those “one-shot” services, feel secure knowing that your witness will
        be in court. Wherever they are, we will serve them. Even the most
        impossible cases, we are confident we will succeed. "Where there is a
        will, there is a way"; Infidelity Investigations will get the job done
        right.
