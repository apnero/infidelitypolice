        <h1>Connecticut Private Investigator Explains How Private Investigation
        Firms Can Help in Certain Situations</h1>
        Leading private investigator says that hiring a private investigation
        agency is a good idea for some people.<br>
        <br>
        “Most people think that they would never need to utilize the service of
        a private detective,” says Christopher Paoletti, Founder and President
        of Infidelity Investigations (http://www.infidelitypolice.com), a
        Connecticut private investigation firm that specializes in infidelity
        cases. “Most of the general public may not ever have a need for a
        private investigator, but under certain distressful circumstances it
        may be warranted.”<br>
        <br>
        According to Paoletti, one such circumstance may include when an
        individual is seeking justice after being a victim of a crime or when a
        loved one has gone missing. However, he says that the most common
        reason for hiring a private investigator is to catch a cheating spouse
        – something that his firm specializes in.<br>
        <br>
        “Unfortunately, a lot of people try to handle a private investigation
        case on their own,” says Paoletti. “That rarely works, however, and the
        person can end up losing good evidence and even wind up getting
        hurt.”<br>
        <br>
        Paoletti says that a private investigator knows where to start when it
        comes to such matters. They have the ability to act in a professional
        manner, have the resources to get the job done and the ability to ‘fly
        under the radar,’ which, Paoletti says, is essential to cracking a
        case.<br>
        <br>
        "Trying to catch a thief or a to catch a cheating spouse aren’t the
        only reasons to hire a private investigator,” explains Paoletti. “When
        it comes to running a business, for example, knowing a potential
        employee’s background is important. A private investigator has the
        resources to ensure that a potential job candidate is the right
        fit.”<br>
        <br>
        Of course, if the reason for hiring a private investigation firm has to
        do with an issue that may involve law enforcement, such as a missing
        person or the investigation of a possible crime, Paoletti says that it
        is important to contact the authorities before contacting a private
        investigator.<br>
        <br>
