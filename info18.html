        <h1>Adultery Statistics</h1>
        Documenting statistics of deaths, marriages, divorces and births is an
        on-going process for federal and state agencies. These events are
        easily monitored, evaluated and analyzed later on. To the contrary
        accurate records on infidelity are not being tracked and can not be
        accomplished. Accurately obtaining data for research of adulterous
        activities, its' causes, background and scope, is impossible.<br>
        <br>
        I have searched the internet for some studies and statistics It should
        be noted these statistics are not scientific and I feel may be over
        stated. However I found them interesting and wanted to share them with
        you.<br>
