        <h1>Valentines Day is a difficult time for Cheaters</h1>
        <a href=
        "http://infidelitypolice.com/"><strong>Cheaters</strong></a>
        have to try to satisfy both their spouse and lover with gifts and time.
        It can be costly and nearly impossible to be in two places at one time,
        it is the spouse who normally gets the short end of the stick. This is
        why the time leading up to Valentines Day is an ideal time to catch
        <strong>cheating</strong> partners.<br>
        <br>
        Most private investigators agree the weeks before February 14 are when
        cheaters leave most evidence of their affairs. Holidays, especially
        Valentines Day is when they take risk they normally would not have to
        take.<br>
        <br>
        Many private investigators say that in the past few years the number of
        people looking for proof of their partner's infidelity has surged. It
        is too painful, to sit around waiting to find out the truth. If there
        is infidelity they want to, know now and move on with their lives.<br>
        <br>
        Christopher Paoletti owner of Infidelity Investigations said
        Valentine's Day requires extra effort on the part of adulterers to
        satisfy their love interests. Paoletti, <a href=
        "http://infidelitypolice.com/"><strong>private
        investigator</strong></a>, said giveaway signs of affairs were
        additional time spent away or coming home late, be particularly aware
        if the partner tells you, "You're are crazy" when confronting them.<br>
        <br>
        Other tell-tale signs are a flurry of activity on the credit card,
        unexplained cash withdrawals and lots of disappearances to urgent
        meetings, he said.<br>
        <br>
        While these things could also be the behavior of a faithful lover
        planning a Valentine's surprise, those paired up with an adulterer
        usually know the difference.<br>
        <br>
        "I find by the time they (clients) come to us they are pretty certain
        something is going on, they just want proof."<br>
        <br>
        I advised those who suspected their loved may be cheating, to talk them
        over with a trusted friend. I also list many signs of a cheating spouse
        on my internet site, <a href=
        "http://www.infidelitypolice.com/">www.infidelitypolice.com</a>.<br>

        <br>
        Paoletti said a few years ago I would receive a couple of calls a week
        about investigating infidelity, but now I get about six enquiries a
        day. The rise of internet dating, which allowed people to create
        fictitious profiles and make contact with hundreds of singles, makes
        adultery easier.<br>
        <br>
        The next time you in Victoria Secrets ask any sales women if it is
        common for them to sell two sets of underwear to customers for
        Valentine's Day.<br>
        <br>
        You may find "One set gets paid for with the credit card for the wife
        and the other gets paid with cash for the 'secretary',''<br>
        <br>
