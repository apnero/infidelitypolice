        <h1>Signs of a Cheating Spouse</h1>


        <ol>
            <li>Intuition or gut feeling. -- It has been my experience that
            when your flight or fight signal is going off there is something
            wrong. Your intuition has bought you this far in life don’t stop
            trusting it now. This and the next sign are the most important
            signs that your spouse boyfriend girlfriend or partners is
            cheating.</li>


            <li>He or she says “You're crazy”, "You don't trust me", or "It’s
            your imagination." when you confront them. -- I hear this all the
            time from clients. You are not crazy something probable is not
            right. When he or she can not come up with a reasonable explanation
            or do attempt to reassure you, they will tell you are crazy. This
            is how they can explain away their actions.</li>


            <li>Excessive use of Internet, e-mail and or text messaging. -- The
            internet makes it very easy to communicate with someone when you
            can not talk to them in person or by telephone. This can be
            accomplished by emails, instant messages or in chat rooms.</li>


            <li>Shutting down the computer or changing screens when you walk
            into the room. -- It is obvious he or she do not want you to see
            what they are doing. What are they hiding? Although I love the
            internet, I have to say it is becoming the number one gateway drug
            to infidelity.</li>


            <li>Going to work early or coming home late. Working a lot of over
            time without the pay.</li>


            <li>Long trips to the store or staying at the gym for excessive
            periods of time. -- I call this stealing time. He or she may need
            an excuse to take away time from you and the family. They will add
            time to things that do not draw to much suspicion.</li>


            <li>Hiding the Home or Cell Phone Bill. Leaving the cell phone in
            the car or keeping the cell phone with them at all times. Has
            another cell phone you do not have access to. Walking out of the
            room when talking on the cell phone, or text messaging.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        These are all signs of deception, especially, when he or she did not
        have these tendencies in the past. These are ways to cover
        deception.<br>


        <ul>
            <li>More interest in their appearance, hygiene and clothes. --
            <em>When this is a change from what is normal in the past,
            infidelity or at least an interest in some one else maybe a
            reason</em></li>


            <li>Becomes more picky, cruel, and defensive during normal
            conversations. -- <em>He or she maybe are hiding a big lie and feel
            you are trying to trap them in this lie. He or she maybe afraid to
            answer your questions, so the best defense is a good
            offense.</em></li>


            <li>Leaves house during an argument. -- <em>Is he or she looking to
            cool things down or is this an excuse to go out?</em></li>


            <li>Tries to hide credit card charges or money spent. -- <em>Again
            there is a difference between privacy and deception. Are your
            finances normally separate or is he or she hiding
            something.</em></li>


            <li>Taking business trips alone or extended trips. -- <em>Has the
            number of trips or length of the trips increased? Are you seeing
            this sign with other sihns of a cheating mate?</em></li>


            <li>Stained undergarments. -- <em>Is he suddenly interested in
            doing the laundry!</em></li>


            <li>Hidden lingerie. -- <em>Is she hiding lingerie she would not
            have normally purchased for her self?</em></li>


            <li>Passenger seat in weird position. -- <em>This maybe an
            indication some one else was in the car.</em></li>


            <li>Phone calls wanting to know where you are? -- <em>He or she may
            does not want to be surprise visit from you or run into
            you.</em></li>


            <li>Comes home not wearing any under garments. -- <em>He or she
            left with wearing undergarments but may not return with any on due
            to stains.</em></li>


            <li>You mate is maxing out all your credit cards and empting your
            bank accounts -- <em>Your mate maybe preparing for a
            divorce.</em></li>
