        <h1>Connecticut Private Investigator Offers Advice on What to do when
        You Suspect that Your Spouse is Cheating</h1>
        Leading private investigator says that suspicions do not always lead to
        proof and there are ways to save a relationship when you feel that
        something might be wrong.<br>
        <br>
        “Thoughts of an affair, whether real and suspected, are a common hazard
        of the modern relationship and they can take an enormous toll on both
        parties,” says Christopher Paoletti, Founder and President of
        Infidelity Investigations (<a href=
        "http://www.infidelitypolice.com/">http://www.infidelitypolice.com</a>),
        a Connecticut private investigation firm that specializes in infidelity
        cases. “First, there is the devastating realization that the person you
        love may be attracted to someone else. Then the question of what may or
        may not be going on arises, which can leave a person physically,
        mentally and emotionally depleted.”<br>
        <br>
        Paoletti says that it is important to know that, sometimes, a spouse's
        affair or flirtation with the idea of an affair may be nothing more
        than a way to explore some aspect of his or her identity. This is
        especially true, he says, when the couple married young and their life
        experiences are limited.<br>
        <br>
        “Often, the victim of a cheating spouse does not want to confront their
        partner or doesn’t want to know the truth,” says Paoletti. “If this is
        the case, and the victim just wants to salvage their relationship,
        there are a number of measures that can be taken.”<br>
        <br>
        Paoletti suggests asking the spouse or partner to set aside a specific
        amount of time, 45 minutes for example, every day to just be together
        and talk. Another idea that he suggests is introducing the subject of a
        friend or neighbor's marital affairs and ask for thoughts on why people
        are unfaithful to their partners.<br>
        <br>
        “Partners can also ask their spouse what changes he or she would like
        to see in the relationship,” says Paoletti. “Let your spouse know that
        you are committed to making your relationship grow and improve and then
        ask for their commitment as well.”<br>
        <br>
        Paoletti suggests that partners continue to keep an open line of
        communication.<br>
        <br>
        “Marriages can come back even from the devastating blow of infidelity,
        as long as both partners are willing to examine themselves and their
        contributions to the positive growth of their relationship,” says
        Paoletti. “Periodic evaluation and re-commitment are essential to
        sustaining any long term relationship.”<br>
        <br>
