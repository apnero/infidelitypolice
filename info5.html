        <h1>Connecticut Private Investigator Says That Infidelity is On the
        Rise</h1>
        Leading private investigator says that a recent study shows that more
        and more spouses are cheating on their significant others.<br>
        <br>
        According to Christopher Paoletti, Founder and President of Infidelity
        Investigations (http://www.infidelitypolice.com), a Connecticut private
        investigation firm that specializes in infidelity cases, the number of
        extramarital affairs is growing at an alarming rate, which is why
        private investigators like himself often work around the clock to help
        alleviate the emotional pain felt by victimized spouses.<br>
        <br>
        “While statistics vary for the rate of infidelity that is taking place,
        mostly due to the amount of secrecy that is involved in such behavior,
        more and more people are admitting to adulterous affairs than ever
        before,” says Paoletti. “According to one study, more than 20 percent
        of married men and nearly 14 percent of married women have admitted to
        having an affair while married.”<br>
        <br>
        According to Paoletti, studies also show that 70 percent of women and
        54 percent of men that were victims of a cheating spouse had no idea
        that an extramarital affair was taking place.<br>
        <br>
        “Because of the statistical increase in infidelity cases and the number
        of online affairs growing as well, a any spouse that thinks their
        significant other is being unfaithful, would be wise to hire a
        trustworthy private investigator to help verify their suspicions or
        alleviate their fears,” says Paoletti.<br>
        <br>
        According to Paoletti, infidelity destroys the lives of all involved,
        including children and other family members. With years experience
        handling the delicate situation of infidelity, Paoletti says that he
        and his staff can provide everyone involved with solutions that can
        resolve infidelity issues discreetly, so that everyone can move on with
        their lives.<br>
        <br>
        “At Infidelity Investigations, we never view our clients as a job,”
        says Paoletti. “We recognize that our clients are people going through
        a life-altering event and that they need someone that can understand,
        respect, and help their situation.”<br>
        <br>
        Although some people feel that hiring a private investigator may
        somehow violate the cheating spouse’s privacy or rights, Paoletti says
        that sometimes it is the only safe and effective way to expose the
        truth.<br>
        <br>

        insured and licensed private investigation firm in the State of
