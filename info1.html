        <h1>Surveillance Is Essential To Any Undercover Investigation, Says
        Connecticut Private Investigator</h1>
        The use of video surveillance and professional surveillance
        investigators is necessary for a successful private investigation.<br>
        <br>
        According to Christopher Paoletti, Founder and President of Infidelity
        Investigations (http://www.infidelitypolice.com), a Connecticut private
        investigation firm that specializes in infidelity cases but also offers
        an array of other private investigation services, surveillance is
        necessary to garner proof of a cheating spouse.<br>
        <br>
        “When it comes to surveillance as part of an infidelity investigation,
        you can’t trust just anyone to handle the task,” says Paoletti. “In
        most cases, you only get one chance to catch a cheating spouse, so
        surveillance operations must be handled with the utmost care and
        diligence.”<br>
        <br>
        When choosing a private investigation firm to determine whether or not
        a spouse has been unfaithful, it is important to pick a company that
        has experience in undercover surveillance. Infidelity Investigations,
        for example, offers a dedicated team of surveillance investigators who
        are committed to what they do.<br>
        <br>
        “Our investigators are highly trained to handle even the most adverse
        surveillance cases, such as when the subject is suspicious that he or
        she may be under surveillance,” says Paoletti. “We use the most
        advanced techniques available for each situation.”<br>
        <br>
        According to Paoletti, video surveillance is the most popular and
        useful form of surveillance when it comes to catching a cheating
        spouse.<br>
        <br>
        “Oftentimes,” he says, “the video footage obtained by a private
        investigator proves incredibly useful during divorce proceedings.”<br>
        <br>
        A good private investigation firm, according to Paoletti, will utilize
        the latest state-of-the-art digital video and digital still cameras to
        document evidence that will successfully meet the needs of its
        clients.<br>
        <br>
        “At Infidelity Investigations, we have conducted hundreds of successful
        video-surveillance operations,” says Poletti. “There is no job that is
        too difficult and there is no subject that is too elusive for our
        investigators.”<br>
        <br>
        Paoletti is so confident in his company’s ability to garner video
        evidence as part of an infidelity investigation that even if another
        agency has unsuccessfully tried, he says that Infidelity Investigations
        will get the job done.<br>
        <br>
        “Whether the surveillance is conducted from a vehicle, on foot, from a
        building, or from up in a tree, we will be there to document any
        pertinent information, action, or evidence,” says Paoletti. "They will
        never even know we are there.”<br>
        Established in 2001, Infidelity Investigations is a bonded, fully
        insured and licensed private investigation firm in the State of
        Connecticut, specializing in infidelity investigations, surveillance,
        background investigations, attorney investigation services, and GPS
        tracking. For more information, call 203-268-6319 or visit <a href=
