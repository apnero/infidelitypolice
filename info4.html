        <h1>Connecticut Private Investigator Offers the Real Facts about
        Cheating Spouses</h1>
     


        <p class="MsoNormal"><i>
        Leading private investigator shares the hard truth about cheating
        spouses.</i><br>
        <br>
        “When someone is in a committed relationship, they hand themselves over
        to their partner, making themselves vulnerable,” says Christopher
        Paoletti, Founder and President of Infidelity Investigations
       ,
        a Connecticut private investigation firm that specializes in infidelity
        cases. “Trust is an important part of a relationship, but when the
        alarm bells sound, scorned spouses need strength.”<br>
        <br>
        A<span style="color: black;">ccording to Paoletti, a cheating spouse or
        significant other can not only cause emotional instability in the
        relationship, but they can put the sexual health of their partner in
        jeopardy if a sexually transmitted disease (STD) is
        introduced.</span><br>
        <br>
        <span style="color: black;">“Just sensing that something isn’t right in
        a relationship could be the clue to a cheating spouse,” says Paoletti.
        “Other things that may not be sure signs of infidelity, but may be a
        clue include a spouse that is distracted or is regularly unavailable,
        habitually checks his or her cell phone, email, or social networking
        site, and doesn’t respond when you try and contact them.”</span><br>
        <br>
        <span style="color: black;">Paoletti also says that if a partner gives
        flowers or an unexpected gift, it could be a response to guilt rather
        than an outpouring of their love. If he or she has suddenly started
        taking more interest in his or her appearance, it also could be a sign
        of cheating.</span><br>
        <br>
        “Of the greatest concerns for anyone who suspects their spouse is
        cheating, is the possibility of contracting a sexually transmitted
        disease,” says Paoletti. “Sexually transmitted diseases are a very real
        fact of life when someone is sleeping with multiple partners.”<br>
        <br>
        According to Paoletti, the best way to protect oneself from sexually
        transmitted diseases (STDs) is to be aware of any new symptoms that may
        be experienced.”<br>
        <br>
        <span style="color: black;">“A spouse should be aware of their own
        sexual health,” says Paoletti. “No one should be afraid to call a
        doctor or get tested to rule out STDs, particularly if they suspect
        that their spouse is cheating.”</span><br>
        <br>
        <span style="color: black;">Paoletti says that anyone continuing to be
        intimate with a cheating spouse or significant other should use condoms
        to safe-guard themselves from contracting an infection.</span><br>
